## **Hello, its my privilege to see you here!**

In 2025, requirements towards Juniors for entry-level developer positions have reached new peaks, which often scare away the majority of potential recruits.

## **Who am I?**

My name is Mikl√≥s and I became a graduate of Computer Science Engineering in February.

## **What is this site for?**

I spent the first few months after graduation with job hunting that was met with mild success and plenty of mistakes.\
The reality is that being a graduate alone is not enough on its own.\
Which I was aware of, since I spent most of my free-time during my uni years working on projects that interested me to figure out what I am truly passionate for.\
Still, the industry of 2025 requires different skills than the ones I currently possess.

To solve my lack of expertise, I called together my most trustable strategists.\
(Me and my favorite mugs of coffee, with cute drawn faces)\
Together, we came up with a battle plan which essentially consists of:

- 92 days, or 3 months spanning from June 1st till August 31th (Also )
- The main goal being that I land an Embedded Software Developer position
- A setup with dev tools and modules to base projects
- Side focus on CI/CD, Cloud, Databases so I improve as a developer

## **How will you get it done?**

The battle plan is available here, which you can freely view at any time:\

Along with adaptation to turn the plan into reality.\
This blog is part of my solution to the problem.\
It was created to:

- Connect with the community
- Provide myself with feedback and long-term motivation
- To inspire people in similar situations, and to keep them hopeful

## **Is the goal too ambitious?**

Mayhaps!\
Is it possible?\
Let's find out together!
