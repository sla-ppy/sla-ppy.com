# TODO:
- Make home button separate from scrollables, but also sticky (in a way it doesn't get covered)
- Make more sticker SVG-s, preferably higher quality, find a new way to do that easier.
- Make table of content edges also have padding 20% left-right

# Ponder about:
- Figure out a new way to have images displayed?
- Create border for image, embeds, etc.?
