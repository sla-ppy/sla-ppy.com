<p>I spent the first few months after graduation with job hunting that was met with mild success and plenty of mistakes.<br>
The reality is that being a graduate alone is not enough on its own.<br>
Which I was aware of, since I spent most of my free-time during my uni years working on projects that interested me to figure out what I am truly passionate for.<br>
Still, the industry of 2025 requires different skills than the ones I currently possess.</p>
<p>To solve my lack of expertise, I called together my most trustable strategists.<br>
(Me and my favorite mugs of coffee, with cute drawn faces)<br>
Together, we came up with a battle plan which essentially consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>92 days, or 3 months spanning from June 1st till August 31th (Also )</li>
<li>The main goal being that I land an Embedded Software Developer position</li>
<li>A setup with dev tools and modules to base projects</li>
<li>Side focus on CI/CD, Cloud, Databases so I improve as a developer</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-will-you-get-it-done"><strong>How will you get it done?</strong><a href="#how-will-you-get-it-done" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>The battle plan is available here, which you can freely view at any time:<br>
<a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVIufPTH8=/?share_link_id=673154583990">Ultimate Super Secret Battle Plan For World Dominance</a></p>
<p>Along with adaptation to turn the plan into reality.<br>
This blog is part of my solution to the problem.<br>
It was created to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect with the community</li>
<li>Provide myself with feedback and long-term motivation</li>
<li>To inspire people in similar situations, and to keep them hopeful</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="is-the-goal-too-ambitious"><strong>Is the goal too ambitious?</strong><a href="#is-the-goal-too-ambitious" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>Mayhaps!<br>
Is it possible?<br>
Let&rsquo;s find out together!</p>
